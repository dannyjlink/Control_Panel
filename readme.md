# Control Panel

## Purpose
This is a project to help me keep up with my skills in PWA development while searching for a new role. Outside of that, the motivation for this is to finally find a use for a 7-inch touchscreen that's been sitting on my shelf for a few years now. 
The goal is to ultimately make a "control panel" for quick actions that wouldn't require me to tab out of whatever I'm doing. Things like muting/deafening & playing soundboard clips for Discord, or for having a place to monitor system resource usage.

There are a few components to this project:
1. 3D printed enclosure to house the screen 
2. The PWA that will be the UI for the control panel (based on React & Electron, see boilerplate used [here](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate))
3. The backend server to run the actions prompted on the front-end
